## Description

This was a school project done in a two weeks to create a portal based rendering engine in OpenGL and use it to display a map. The project was over scoped but we managed to display two rooms next to each other by using portals rather than standard rendering. This is done using the stencil buffer to section off possible portals and then drawing the room led to by the portal over the stenciled off area.
